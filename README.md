# Hey there, you've found my stash of MacOS IR tools :)
This is a place where I publish my collection of tools, scripts, and queries that I use in incident response with MacOS endpoints.

These tools are designed to quickly scrape information about the machine and potential infection/persistence vectors

These queries use OSquery by Facebook so you'll need to install that to run these tools: https://osquery.io/downloads/official/5.1.0

Happy Hunting :)
